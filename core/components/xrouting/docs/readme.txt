XRouting
==================

XRouting is a simple plugin that handles requests for different contexts. It automatically switches the context based on a (sub)domain AND/OR subfolder.

It's like the Gateway plugin from the docs, except you don't have to manually edit the plugin: it takes
the http_host and base_url settings you have already configured in your context and routes based on that. It caches the http_host/base_url => context relation so it doesn't perform excessive database lookups.


Instructions
------------------

All you need to do is to install this plugin and make sure your contexts have `http_host` and `base_url` context settings set. `http_host_aliases` can be used optionally.
